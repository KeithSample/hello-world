Tutorial
My name is Keith, I am a full time process engineeer who has recently graduated from school with a degree in Chemical Engineering. I am looking to expand my skillset and learn more about programming. I have had brief introductions to programming in college and in my professional career and each time I find myself interested to learn more.
